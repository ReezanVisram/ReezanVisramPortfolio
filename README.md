# My Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal website showcasing my academics, work experience, and projects!

## Components
1. Resume Parser - Written in Python, this service automatically parses the resume I upload and populates the "Experience" section on the site.
2. Backend - Written in Go, receives webhooks from Github whenever I star a repository, and uses that to populate the "Projects" section on the site. The backend is also responsible for serving the contents of the website that are stored in MongoDB.
3. Frontend - Written using Svelte, this is the client-facing component of the site.
